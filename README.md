# Video-post-generator
A python script that overlays videos with reddit posts
It currently only works on windows. There is no plan to implement a linux version as of now.

This is a side project by Evan Johnson.
The post generator is currently a work in progress.
As of 1/13/23, only the audio file is created from a reddit post.
The next step is to merge the audio and video.

Before running the script, please assure that you have a .env file with your Reddit credentials and Bot keys.
Place this .env file in the 'text reader' file.

To run the script, open powershell or command prompt and run 'python getPost.py'.
The script will check for dependencies and install them if necessary.
